# Copilot Instructions for profile_website_v2

## Project Overview
- This is a Vite + React app generated by Base44, designed to communicate with the Base44 API.
- The main entry point is `src/main.jsx`, with the root component in `src/App.jsx`.
- UI components are organized under `src/components/` and `src/components/ui/`.
- API integrations are handled in `src/api/`.
- Utility functions are in `src/lib/utils.js` and `src/utils/index.ts`.

## Developer Workflows
- **Start Development:**
  - Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
  - Run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.
- **Build for Production:**
  - Run `npm run build` to generate production assets.
- **Deployment:**
  - GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/jekyll-gh-pages.yml`) is present, but the app is a Vite+React project. Jekyll workflow may be legacy or for docs; verify before modifying deployment.

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- **Component Structure:**
  - Use functional React components, with hooks for state and effects.
  - UI primitives (buttons, dialogs, etc.) are in `src/components/ui/` and are reused across pages.
- **API Communication:**
  - API logic is separated in `src/api/` (e.g., `base44Client.js`, `entities.js`, `integrations.js`).
  - Use fetch/axios patterns for API calls; check for custom client logic in `base44Client.js`.
- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and used throughout components.
  - Global styles are in `src/index.css` and `src/App.css`.
- **Routing/Layout:**
  - Page-level components are in `src/pages/` (e.g., `Portfolio.jsx`, `Layout.jsx`).
  - No explicit router found; navigation may be manual or handled in `Layout.jsx`.
- **TypeScript:**
  - Some utilities use TypeScript (`src/utils/index.ts`), but most code is JavaScript/JSX.

## Integration Points
- **Base44 API:**
  - All external data flows through the Base44 API clients in `src/api/`.
- **UI Library:**
  - Custom UI components in `src/components/ui/` are preferred over third-party libraries.
- **Build Tools:**
  - Vite is used for fast builds and hot reloads (`vite.config.js`).
  - PostCSS and Tailwind are configured for CSS processing.

## Examples
- To add a new API integration, create a module in `src/api/` and import it where needed.
- To create a new UI element, add it to `src/components/ui/` and use it in page or feature components.

## Cautions
- The Jekyll workflow may not match the current app stack; confirm its purpose before editing deployment logic.
- Follow the established folder structure for new features to maintain consistency.
